# React Formi

A library to help you manage those pesky forms and all the pitfalls that come with custom form data, responses and errors.

Eventually, Formi hopes to handle validation as well.

This idea was born of the annoyance of having to create large, untyped data objects each time for complex forms. Formi's goal is to help enforce form data typing and handle some of the boilerplate required to drive your forms while letting you use whatever UI elements/library you want.

Formi handles the data while you build the UI.
